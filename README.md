# MUSIC LISTENING STATISTICS ON ARTIST LY TRANG'S ALBUM
* Ly Trang is a young artist. She has been active on Sportify since 2018. She released an album on Sportify called "Snail Skeleton" and a live concert collab with two other artists.The genre music that Ly Trang is pursuing is experimental pop and art pop. The songs she creates always have a good effect on the listener, although she is a young artist, Ly Trang also has a certain community of listeners.
* So today I want to use the pandas library to analyze the statistics on Ly Trang's album (statistics are from the date 21/09/2021 to 18/10/2021 on Sportify)
# What is python pandas library?
*The pandas library in python is an open source library that effectively supports data manipulation. This is a powerful data processing and analysis toolkit of the python programming language. This library is widely used in both research and development of data science applications. This library uses a data structure called Dataframe.

*Load the library:

```( import pandas as pd}```

```(import numpy as np}```
* To read a file .csv i use the "read_csv".And will be returned a dataframe.
